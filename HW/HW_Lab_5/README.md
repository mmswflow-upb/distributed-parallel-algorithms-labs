# DS Lab 5 — MPI (C)

This repository contains solutions for **Lab Exercises** and **Homework** from *DS Lab5 (MPI)*.

- `LAB/` — solutions for Exercises 1–3
- `HW/` — solutions for Homework 1–2

Each folder has its own `README.md` with build/run examples.

> Notes: Programs are written in **C** using **MPI** and compiled with `mpicc`, then executed with `mpirun` (as shown in the lab slides).
