# How to make use of these lab solutions

## Structure

- **Lab_Demo** means the code directly taken from the slides of the lab/moodle and prepared to run and function as intended by teacher.

- **Lab_Tasks** means my solutions which you will have to edit

## Usage

- Always read the **README** files from each lab to understand how to run/setup the environment for running the code/app
- Always edit what's in the **Lab_Tasks** (they're my implementations), edit numerical examples too.
- Upload screenshots of how you're using the app/code from Lab_Tasks
- Sometimes you will have to upload screenshots of the **Lab_Demo** running too, not just your implementation/variation of Lab_Tasks, do it on your OWN PC so its clear that you did it

## Instructions per Lab

### Lab 1

Take demo and change the styling of the frontend and change the type of the data stored to products. Take screenshots of demo too.

### Lab 2

Change the implementation of Lab_Tasks of Part I in such a way that it still keeps these functionalities, but make sure you change the code and output:

- Implement a client-server application where several clients can post images like Photography on Pinterest.

- A client can also request images from the server according to a given keyword

Change credentials of accounts in Demo in part II and run it,.

### Lab 3

Change the implementation of Lab_Tasks in such a way that it still keeps these functionalities, but make sure you change the code and output.

- Exercise 1: Enrich the above classes by allowing it to perform additions, multiplications, divisions.

- Exercise 2: Design and implement an aerial flights system along with a GUI that uses RMI that allows the
clients to reserve airplane tickets (a Seat object) from multiple airplane companies. It must be
possible to book travels that involve multiple airlines.

### Lab 4

Change the implementation of Lab_Tasks in such a way that it still keeps these functionalities, but make sure you change the code and output:

- Exercise 1: allow the system to also perform operations like subtraction, multiplication and
division.
- Exercise 2: write a RPC program that computes the lowest common multiple (c.m.m.m.c.) of several
numbers taken from the keyboard, as well as the greatest common divisor (c.m.m.d.c).

### Lab 5

Change the implementation of Lab_Tasks/Part_I in such a way that it still keeps these functionalities, but make sure you change the code and output:

- Exercise 1: Make in parallel the sum of an array with 6
elements. Divide the computations between two
processes.

- Exercise 2: Write a program that computes the average of an
array with 10 elements in one process and pass the
result to a second process.

- Exercise 3: Make the addition of two matrices in parallel, by
dividing the computations between two processes.

Change the implementation of Lab_Tasks/Part_II in such a way that it still keeps these functionalities but make sure you cahnge the code and the way it outputs things and files structure and file names:

Write a program in C using CUDA, and it must do:

- Matrix multiplication

- Inverse of a matrix

### HW Lab 5

Change the implementation of HW of lab 5 in such a way that it still keeps these functionalities, but make sure you change the code and output:

- Exercise 1: Split the array into 2 arrays, compute sums in parallel, return final sum and processing time on a 3rd process

- Exercise 2: Calculates the multiplication of two matrices.

### Lab 6



### HW Lab 6


Change the implementation of HW of lab 6 in such a way that it still keeps these functionalities, but make sure you change the code and output: 

- Include a speech to text and text to speech functionality for the lab bot program.

### Labs 7-11

Follow the lab slides, or my vids but dont name some code files the same way I do.
