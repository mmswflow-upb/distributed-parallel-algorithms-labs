# Lab_Demo (Lab 6) — OOP & Files in Python

This folder contains **demo / reference implementations** based on the lab slides:
- File I/O basics (`files_demo.py`)
- OOP inheritance & overriding with `Project`, `Employee`, `Manager`, `Programmer` (`employee_project_demo.py`)


## Requirements
- Python 3.9+ (should work on 3.8+ as well)

## How to run

```bash
# 1) File I/O demo
python files_demo.py

# 2) Employee / Project salary demo (from slides)
python employee_project_demo.py


## Notes
The code mirrors the concepts in the lab PDF (Lab 6: OOP and Bots in Python), including:
- `open/read/write/seek/tell` usage (see slides pages 2–5)
- inheritance and overriding (pages 7–10)
